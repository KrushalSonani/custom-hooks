Custom hooks are a powerful feature in React that allow you to extract reusable logic from your components. Here are some useful custom hooks in React:

## Custom Useful Hooks
That make your coding life much easier: 


1. [useFilter](https://github.com/KrushalSonani/custom-hooks-array/tree/main/src/useFilter)

  > This hook takes an array and a filter function as input, and returns a new array that contains only the elements that pass the filter. This can be useful for implementing search or filtering functionality in your app.

2. [useArray](https://github.com/KrushalSonani/custom-hooks-array/tree/main/src/useArray)
 
  > This hook provides a simple way to manage state for an array, including adding, removing, and updating elements.

3. [useMemoArray](https://github.com/KrushalSonani/custom-hooks-array/tree/main/src/useMemoArray)
  > This custom hook that memoizes an array based on a set of dependencies.

4. [useSort](https://github.com/KrushalSonani/custom-hooks-array/tree/main/src/useSort)
  > The useSort hook takes an array of objects, a key to sort by, and a direction (either "asc" or "desc"). The hook returns a sorted array based on the given parameters. The example then uses this hook to sort a list of users in a table, with the ability to toggle the sort direction by clicking a button.

5. [usePagination](https://github.com/KrushalSonani/custom-hooks-array/tree/main/src/usePagination)
  > This custom hook allows you to paginate an array of data. It provides methods for changing the current page, and returns a new array of data that only contains the elements for the current page.
